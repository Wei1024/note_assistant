# Phase 2 Implementation Complete

**Status**: ✅ Code implemented, ready for testing
**Date**: 2025-01-21

---

## What Was Implemented

### Core Services

1. **`api/services/semantic.py`** - Embedding & Vector Search
   - `generate_embedding()` - Generate 384-dim embeddings using sentence-transformers
   - `store_embedding()` - Save embeddings to graph_nodes.embedding (BLOB)
   - `find_similar_notes()` - NumPy brute-force cosine similarity search
   - `create_semantic_edges()` - Create edges for similar notes (threshold >= 0.7)

2. **`api/services/linking.py`** - Entity & Tag Linking
   - `create_entity_links()` - Link notes sharing WHO/WHAT/WHERE entities
   - `create_tag_links()` - Link notes sharing tags (Jaccard >= 0.3)
   - Normalization: Case-insensitive matching for entities and tags
   - Edge weight = number of shared entities (stronger links = more shared)

3. **`api/main.py`** - Background Task Integration
   - Added `BackgroundTasks` to `/capture_note` endpoint
   - `process_semantic_and_linking()` runs after response sent
   - Non-blocking: API returns immediately, edges created asynchronously

### Test Scripts

1. **`test_phase2_semantic.py`**
   - Test embedding generation
   - Verify similarity computation
   - Check embeddings in database

2. **`test_phase2_linking.py`**
   - Import all 30 test notes
   - Wait for background processing
   - Analyze edge creation
   - Generate reports: CSV, TXT, JSON

## Architecture Decisions

### Vector Search: NumPy (Now) → FAISS (Future)
- **Current**: NumPy brute-force (simple, fast for <1K notes)
- **Migration path**: Swap to FAISS when scaling to 5K+ notes
- **Reason**: No premature optimization, easy migration later

### Entity Linking: WHO/WHAT/WHERE
- Links created for **any shared entity** (even just 1)
- Weight = number of shared entities (1 = weak, 5 = strong)
- Philosophy: "A link is a link" - let weight represent strength

### Tag Linking: Jaccard Similarity
- Threshold: >= 0.3 (at least 30% overlap)
- Weight = Jaccard coefficient (0.3 to 1.0)
- Normalization handles "ai-research" = "AI Research" = "ai_research"

### Edge Storage: Unidirectional
- Store once: A→B where A.id < B.id (lexicographically)
- Query bidirectionally: `WHERE src_node_id = X OR dst_node_id = X`
- Avoids duplication, easier consistency

### Background Tasks
- FastAPI BackgroundTasks (built-in, simple)
- Runs after API response sent (~2-3s per note)
- User doesn't wait for embedding/linking

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- `sentence-transformers` (~200MB with model)
- `scikit-learn` (if not already installed)
- `networkx` (for future clustering)

### 2. Test Embedding Generation
```bash
python test_phase2_semantic.py
```

**Expected output**:
- Model loads successfully
- Embeddings generated (384-dim, normalized)
- Similarity scores computed correctly

### 3. Clear Database (Optional - for clean test)
```bash
# Optional: Start fresh for clean results
rm data/notes.db
```

### 4. Start API Server
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Watch logs for:
- `[Background] Processing semantic links for...`
- `[Background] ✅ Embedding generated...`
- `[Background] ✅ Semantic edges created...`
- `[Background] 🎉 Completed processing...`

### 5. Run Integration Test
```bash
# Terminal 2: Run test
python test_phase2_linking.py
```

**What it does**:
1. Imports 30 test notes via `/capture_note`
2. Waits 90 seconds for background tasks
3. Queries database for all edges
4. Generates reports in `test_data/`

**Expected outputs**:
- `test_data/phase2_edges_<timestamp>.csv`
- `test_data/phase2_linking_report_<timestamp>.txt`
- `test_data/phase2_linking_results_<timestamp>.json`

### 6. Review Results

Open the generated reports and validate:

**Semantic edges** (similarity-based):
- ✅ Notes about same topic linked (e.g., "Sarah meeting" + "Sarah email")
- ✅ Similarity scores reasonable (0.7-1.0 range)
- ❌ Check for false positives (unrelated notes linked)

**Entity links** (WHO/WHAT/WHERE):
- ✅ Notes sharing people linked (e.g., both mention "Sarah")
- ✅ Notes sharing concepts linked (e.g., both mention "FAISS")
- ✅ Notes sharing locations linked (e.g., both mention "Zoom")
- ✅ Weight reflects number of shared entities
- ❌ Check normalization (e.g., "sarah" = "Sarah")

**Tag links** (Jaccard similarity):
- ✅ Notes with overlapping tags linked
- ✅ Jaccard scores reasonable (0.3-1.0 range)
- ❌ Check normalization (e.g., "ai-research" = "AI Research")

### 7. Manual Spot Checks

Pick a few note pairs from the reports and verify:
1. Do they actually share the entities shown in metadata?
2. Is the similarity/weight accurate?
3. Should they be linked? (human judgment)

---

## Expected Edge Counts (30 notes)

Based on typical test data:
- **Semantic edges**: 10-25 edges (notes with >0.7 similarity)
- **Entity links (WHO)**: 5-15 edges (shared people)
- **Entity links (WHAT)**: 10-20 edges (shared concepts)
- **Entity links (WHERE)**: 3-10 edges (shared locations)
- **Tag links**: 8-15 edges (shared tags with Jaccard >= 0.3)

**Total**: ~35-80 edges expected

If you get significantly fewer edges:
- Check background task logs for errors
- Verify embeddings were generated (run test_phase2_semantic.py)
- Check test notes have sufficient WHO/WHAT/WHERE/tags extracted

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No edges found"
**Causes**:
1. Background tasks didn't complete (wait longer)
2. Embeddings not generated (check logs for errors)
3. Similarity threshold too high (no notes >0.7 similar)
4. Test notes lack shared entities/tags

**Solutions**:
- Check server logs for `[Background]` messages
- Run `test_phase2_semantic.py` to verify embeddings work
- Query database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graph_nodes WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL`

### "Module not found: sentence_transformers"
**Cause**: Dependencies not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Background task errors"
**Check logs for specific error**, common issues:
- Database locked (multiple connections)
- Embedding model download failed (network issue)
- Out of memory (embedding model ~200MB)

### Slow performance
**Expected times**:
- Embedding generation: ~1-2s per note
- Similarity search (30 notes): <100ms
- Entity linking: ~50-100ms
- Total background task: ~2-3s per note

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 is **successful** if:

1. ✅ All 30 notes have embeddings generated
2. ✅ Semantic edges created (10+ edges with similarity >= 0.7)
3. ✅ Entity edges created (15+ edges for WHO/WHAT/WHERE)
4. ✅ Tag edges created (8+ edges with Jaccard >= 0.3)
5. ✅ Normalization works ("Sarah" = "sarah")
6. ✅ Manual review shows edges make sense
7. ✅ No crashes or errors in logs

---

## Migration to FAISS (Future)

When you reach 5K+ notes or need faster search:

1. Add `faiss-cpu` to requirements.txt
2. Create `api/services/faiss_search.py`:
   - `build_faiss_index()` - Build index from embeddings
   - `search_faiss()` - Query index
3. Update `find_similar_notes()` in semantic.py:
   ```python
   if USE_FAISS and node_count > 5000:
       return search_faiss(...)
   else:
       return search_numpy(...)  # current code
   ```

**Effort**: ~2-3 hours, zero breaking changes

---

## Phase 2.5: Clustering (Deferred)

After validating linking quality, we can add:
- NetworkX graph building from database
- Louvain community detection
- Cluster assignment storage
- LLM-generated cluster summaries

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

---

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check server logs for `[Background]` messages
2. Run `test_phase2_semantic.py` to isolate embedding issues
3. Query database directly to check embeddings/edges
4. Review generated reports for edge quality

Good luck! 🚀
